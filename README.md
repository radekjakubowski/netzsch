# R. Jakubowski - Netzsch recruitment

## Prerequisites

.NET7 SDK, Windows, PowerShell

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository or download as a zip and extract.
2. Navigate to scripts in solution folder (src/Scripts). 
3. Now, you have two options:
  * you can start both of PowerShell scripts by double-clicking `run-all` script
  * you can run `1RunServer` script and then `2RunLocalClients` script separately via right-clicking and choosing `Run with PowerShell`

I hope, that instructions are clear.

Wishing you the best,
Radek
